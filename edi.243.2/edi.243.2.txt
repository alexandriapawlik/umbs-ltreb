            Disturbances to forests, such as logging or wildfires, typically lead
            to large losses of carbon and nutrients from both the plants and soils
            of the ecosystem. Virtually all forests are in some state of recovery
            from such disturbances, whether caused naturally or by humans.
            Knowledge of the time required for a forest to recover its original
            amounts of carbon and nutrients after a disturbance is not complete,
            nor is an understanding of how regrowing plants, recovering soils and
            the year to year variation in climate interact to control recovery as
            a forest ages. This project takes advantage of long existing research
            plots in forests at the University of Michigan Biological Station to
            figure out how changes in forest structure, carbon and nitrogen
            contents of the forests, and variations in climate act together
            through time to influence how fast trees grow, nitrogen is retained,
            and carbon is captured and stored in forests. Scientists and students
            will make regular measurements of the types of trees, their stem sizes
            and mass, their patterns of leaf arrangement, the amounts of carbon
            and nitrogen in soils, and other factors in five forest that were cut
            and burned in 1936, 1948, 1954, 1980, and 1998 and so today range from
            15 years to 115 years old. Several nearby much older forests will also
            be sampled. This will let the project link disturbances, climate and
            ecology for forests that are broadly representative of those across
            the northern United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.

                    Researchers used dbh tapes and / or calipers to measure the diameter
                    at breast height (dbh, 1.37 above ground) of every tree within the
                    boundaries of each plot. For some plots, the location (azimuth and
                    distance) from plot center (or corner post) was determined. For some
                    plots, dbh values were assigned as classes (e.g., 6-8 cm dbh) and the
                    number of stems of each species within each diameter class was
                    recorded.

Thus, each row represents a unique measurement of a tree (not a duplicate).

As viewed from the plot center, subplots are located 6 m from plot center at compass headings of 0, 120, and 240 degrees. The innermost right-hand corner of each subplot is 6 m from plot center; thence, plots extend 6 m further out the transect.
