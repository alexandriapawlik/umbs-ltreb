FOR FUTURE DATA COLLECTION:
	
- create a table of all trees, their tags as they change, their plots, and the year they were planted (currently, there is no best way to identify unique trees in the datasets)
- could I give annotated outlines of the final cleaned tables to give an idea of what format I would recommend data be compatible with in the future?
