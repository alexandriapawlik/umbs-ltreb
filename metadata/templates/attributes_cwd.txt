Plot_ID	Standardized name of the LTREB plot containing the debris that was collected. Check the plot descriptions file.	character				
CWD_Subplot_ID	Indicates which of the 3, 6mx6m subplots located in each LTREB 18m radius plot. As viewed from the plot center, subplots are located 6 m from plot center at compass headings of 0, 120, and 240 degrees. The innermost right-hand corner of each subplot is 6 m from plot center; thence, plots extend 6 m further out the transect.	numeric	unitless		NA	Attribute not recorded.
Date	Date that measurement was taken.	Date		YYYY-MM-DD		
Species	A four-character code to represent the species of the tree being measured.	categorical			NA	Attribute not recorded or unknown.
Status	Notes if the debris is a stump or stump piece.	character			NA	Attribute not recorded.
Length	Length of the piece of coarse woody debris in m. Lengths are either for the entire piece, if located entirely in the subplot, or for pieces that extend outside the subplot, the amount of length of the piece that is located within the subplot.	numeric	meter		NA	Attribute not recorded.
Endpoint_1_Diameter	Diameter, in cm, at one end of the piece of coarse woody debris. Measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a caliper.	numeric	centimeter			
Midpoint_Diameter	Diameter, in cm, at the midpoint (center) of the piece of coarse woody debris. If the piece extends outside the subplot, this is the diameter at the midpoint relative to the portion of the piece that is within the subplot.	numeric	centimeter			
Endpoint_2_Diameter	Diameter, in cm, at the other end of the piece of coarse woody debris. Measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a caliper.	numeric	centimeter			
Decay_Class_Whole_Piece	The observer's assigned decay class of the whole piece of coarse woody debris (i.e. visually "averaged" to best represent the decay class of the whole piece even when it consists of portions of differing decay classes).	categorical				
Average_Diameter	The average diameter in cm of the piece of coarse woody debris within the subplot, as computed from the three measured diameter.	numeric	centimeter			
Density	The estimated specific density of coarse woody debris for that species and decay class combination. Estimated densities are based upon direct measurements of ACRU, BEPA, POGR, and QURU coarse woody debris across decay classes at UMBS~Flux AmeriFlux site in the late 1990s - early 2000's; these data are available upon request.	numeric	gramsPerCubicCentimeter		NA	Attribute not known.
Estimated_Volume_Tapered	The computed volume of the piece of coarse woody debris in cubic cm based on the length and average diameter.	numeric	cubicCentimeter		NA	Attribute not calculated.
Estimated_Biomass_Tapered	The product of volume in cubic cm and density in grams per cubic cm for that piece of coarse woody debris.	numeric	gram		NA	Attribute not calculated.
