For AGB and Saplings:

Researchers used dbh tapes and / or calipers to measure the diameter at breast height (dbh, 1.37 above ground) of every tree within the boundaries of each plot. For some plots, the location (azimuth and distance) from plot center (or corner post) was determined. For some plots, dbh values were assigned as classes (e.g., 6-8 cm dbh) and the number of stems of each species within each diameter class was recorded.

The equations below are to be used in conjunction with the Allometric_equations.csv file.

Allometry AG biomass = a * dbh^b * height^c
height = a*dbh^b
