      Disturbances to forests, such as logging or wildfires, typically lead to large losses of carbon and nutrients from both the plants and soils of the ecosystem. Virtually all forests are in some state of recovery from such disturbances, whether caused naturally or by humans. Knowledge of the time required for a forest to recover its original amounts of carbon and nutrients after a disturbance is not complete, nor is an understanding of how regrowing plants, recovering soils and the year to year variation in climate interact to control recovery as a forest ages. This project takes advantage of long existing research plots in forests at the University of Michigan Biological Station to figure out how changes in forest structure, carbon and nitrogen contents of the forests, and variations in climate act together through time to influence how fast trees grow, nitrogen is retained, and carbon is captured and stored in forests. Scientists and students will make regular measurements of the types of trees, their stem sizes and mass, their patterns of leaf arrangement, the amounts of carbon and nitrogen in soils, and other factors in five forest that were cut and burned in 1936, 1948, 1954, 1980, and 1998 and so today range from 20 years to 120 years old. Several nearby much older forests will also be sampled. This will let the project link disturbances, climate and ecology for forests that are broadly representative of those across the northern United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.

          For AGB and Saplings:
          Researchers used dbh tapes and / or calipers to measure the diameter at breast height (dbh, 1.37 above ground) of every tree within the boundaries of each plot. For some plots, the location (azimuth and distance) from plot center (or corner post) was determined. For some plots, dbh values were assigned as classes (e.g., 6-8 cm dbh) and the number of stems of each species within each diameter class was recorded.
          The equations below are to be used in conjunction with the Allometric_equations.csv file.
          Allometry AG biomass = a * dbh^b * height^c
height = a*dbh^b

            NA
            If measurement was recorded before 2019 then no 2019 tag information exists. Otherwise LTREB tag was unknown as of 2019 measurement.
          
        
        
          LTREB_Tag_2014
          Tags installed as part of plot census during LTREB initiation in 2014. In plots never before sampled, but sampled first in 2014 for LTREB, all trees will have tag IDs. For LTREB plots within older historic plots, all trees within the LTREB 0.1 ha (18 m radius) plot will have these tag IDs and possibly an Old_Tag. LTREB 2019 tags were assumed to match 2014 tags unless otherwise specified.

            NA
            If measurement was recorded before 2019 then tree did not have LTREB tag as of date of measurement. Otherwise tree was planted after 2014 or could not be matched to a 2014 tree record.
          
        
        
          Old_Tag
          Tree tag number (or letter, or combination) assigned as part of historic (pre-2014) plot censuses. In many of the long-term forest inventory plots, trees were never tagged, but were measured as individuals each time a census was performed. For large historic plots, LTREB plots installed within these plots sometimes encountered these old tags and their identities were transcribed into the LTREB plot inventory dataset to enable tracking across past inventory data.

          Origin_Year
          Year of stand initiation. As best as can be determined from historic records or dendrochronology, this is the year that the trees present on a plot became established after some significant disturbance (e.g., clearcutting or stand-replacing fire). Often assumed to be equal to the age of the oldest trees present on the plot.

          Root_C_Stock
          Calculated fine root (less than 2 mm diameter) carbon stock, based on sample fine root dry mass (g) and assuming a 47% carbon concentration. For O and A horizons, computation is fine root dry carbon mass (g) of the sample, collected from a 15x15 cm (= 225 square cm) template, scaled to mass in Mg (= 1000000 g) and area in ha (10000000 square cm). For mineral soil horizons collected with a corer, calculated as the volumetric root mass (g roots per cubic cm of fine earth), converted to carbon mass, divided by the thickness of the increment to get g of root carbon per square cm of soil, scaled to mass in Mg (= 1000000 g) and area in ha (10000000 square cm).

          Soil_C_Stock
          Calculated soil carbon stock (for the less than 2 mm fine earth fraction). For O and A horizons, computation is the carbon concentration times the mass density of the fine earth fraction, collected from a 225 square cm template, scaled to mass in Mg (= 1000000 g) and area in ha (10000000 square cm). For mineral soil increments, calculated as the product of the carbon concentration times the bulk density (g per cubic cm) times the increment thickness (cm) to yield g of carbon per square cm, scaled to mass in Mg (= 1000000 g) and area in ha (10000000 square cm).
